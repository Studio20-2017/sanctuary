<h1>How U.S. Policy Fueled Mexican Migration</h1>
<p>If a Mexican farmer needs to sell his coffee for ten dollars to make a profit, an American farmer needs to sell his coffee for eight dollars. This is because the American farmer has wiggle room to make less and still profit off of his commodity.<p>

<p>(Part centering what Jesus’s family did for a living in Mexico)<p>

The Mexican government, or any government that wants to protect local farmers, would normally put a trade tariff on American coffee imports. If American coffee were to sit on the shelves of a supermarket in Mexico, it might be twelve dollars as opposed to the minimum eight the farmer needs to make a profit. A trade tariff prevents the American farmer from selling her coffee cheaper in a Mexican supermarket. 

In Mexico, this makes it easier for local Mexican products to compete on the shelves with American imports. Without tariffs, lower-priced American coffee would imperil the sales of higher-priced Mexican coffee, halting the Mexican farmer’s revenue stream. Without tariffs, local farmers in every agricultural industry can’t compete with American products, and the Mexican economy suffers.

In 1994, Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with the intention to increase the flow of goods and break down trade barriers between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. “NAFTA means jobs,” Clinton said. NAFTA reduced tariffs on American imports to Mexico, or got rid of them altogether. 

Through NAFTA, some American products entered the Mexican market for the first time. Mexico was finally able to get their hands on the same Krispy Kreme products Americans enjoyed, so the deal was celebrated as a success, despite America and Canada reaping disproportionately more benefits. Flooded with American products muscling out sales of local products, the Mexican economy was left in ruins.

During the Great 2008 recession, Mexico’s economy was inextricably linked to the U.S. economy through NAFTA. Mexico suffered more than any country in Latin America. 

Thus began one of the largest waves of Mexican migrations the the United States. Jesus’s family was one of such families, after American products imperiled his family’s revenue stream. For a better education and economic opportunities, Jesus’s family left a desolate Puebla, one of the three poorest Mexican states.
