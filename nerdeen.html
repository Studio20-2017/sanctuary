    <h1 style="color:#f4fff8;">A Timeline of Palestine</h1>

<h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">1917: After the British Mandate</h2>
<p id="transparentbox"><span>In 1917, Britain sent troops to occupy Palestine and declared its support for a Jewish homeland in the Balfour Declaration. This document stated that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.” At the time, less than 10 percent of Palestine's residents were Jewish. The declaration was later folded into the British Mandate, which laid the foundation for the creation of Israel. The British civil administration ruled the region from 1920 to 1948. </span></p>

<h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">1946: Jewish settlers take root</h2>
<p id="transparentbox"><span>The 1920 British Mandate encouraged Jewish settlers to emigrate from Europe. By 1946, they had grown to 33 percent of the population in Palestine, with Zionist Jews controlling 6 percent of historic Palestine. </span></p>

  <h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">1947: The UN proposal</h2>
  <p id="transparentbox"><span>In 1947, the U.N.’s partition plan divided the region. Despite outrage from Palestinian Arabs, 55 percent of historic Palestine became a Jewish state, leaving 45 percent to a non-contiguous Arab state. Jerusalem was given special international status. </span></p>

 <h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">1948: Arab-Israeli War</h2>
 <p id="transparentbox"><span>The 10-month war between Israel and Arab states ended in an Israeli victory. More territory from historic Palestine went to Israel.  </span></p>

    <div id="map-trigger-5" class="map-trigger"></div>
    <h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">1967: Six-Day War</h2>
  <p id="transparentbox"><span>Israel’s decisive victory over Egypt, Jordan and Syria led to 100 percent control of Palestine. The Six-Day War, also known as the June War, expelled 300,000 Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank; 100,000 Syrians became refugees. Meanwhile, Jewish minorities groups in Arab countries were also expelled, with many fleeing to Israel or Europe.

  <h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">Today</h2>
  <p id="transparentbox"> <span>Today, more than 6 million Palestinian refugees have become one of the largest refugee populations in history. About one in three refugees are Palestinian. While some territory was returned in 1994, Israel occupies much of Palestine today.</span></p>

<h1 style="color:#f4fff8;">Shifting borders</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/heysetareh">Setareh Baig</a></p>

<p id="transparentbox"><span>
Nerdeen and her parents are Brooklyn-based New Yorkers. They found sanctuary here from an earlier life among the world’s 6 million Palestinians refugees -- one of the largest refugee populations in human history. 
<br>
Their numbers grew after the 1948 war with Israel. Back then, 85 percent of these Palestinians were living in an area that would become the future Israel. By 1967, the Six-Day War forced an additional 280,000 to 325,000 Palestinians from Israeli-captured territories into refugee camps. 
<br>
Nerdeen’s story begins in Jordan. Because of the war, Nerdeen’s father fled his native village of Beit Iksa to Jordan, where he met her mother, another Beit Iksa native. When Nerdeen was barely two years old, the family came to America. 
<br>
Today, the Palestinians living under the Israeli occupation do not have rights of citizenship. They cannot vote or make decisions that impact their lives. Palestinians have no control over the flow of goods. Access to electricity and water is limited. Their travel is limited to occupied territories.
<br>
International leaders warn that occupation threatens the idea of a peaceful, two-state solution for the two countries.
<br>
 </span></p>

<h2 style="color:#f4fff8;">Settlements</h2>

<p id="transparentbox"><span>
 Controversy continues as the Israeli government steps up plans for expanding new housing for its citizens within Palestinian territory. In April 2017, 212 new settler units in East al-Quds were approved. This follows the January 2014 announcement plans to build 2,500 new settlement homes in the West Bank.
<br>
The new settlements have brought more Israeli police forces into the region, which critics say is threatening plans for creating two separate states with defined borders. 
<br>
The growing Israeli presence has continued despite international alarm. In January 2017, 70 countries -- including the United States -- met in Paris to warn Israel against expansion.  
<br>
As for Pres. Trump, he recently said settlements “don’t help the process,” and he doesn’t believe that “going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace.” But Jared Kushner, his senior advisor and son-in-law, donated $58,500 to expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank between 2011 and 2013, according to the Washington Post.
